## Monotonic stack
- A stack that maintains its elements in either increasing or decreasing order
- always moves in one direction
- two types : Monotonically increasing stack and monotonically decreasing stack
- it helps to solve problems like
```
next greater element
next smaller element
largest rectangle in histogram
daily temperatures
stock span
trapping rain water
```
